# [NWAPI] Plugin, not EXILED.
a simple, but capable custom item system! (currently WIP)

once the system works, it's pretty easy to add your own custom items!

simply reference the CustomItems dll in your plugin (config not supported due to how complex it would be) and create a new instance of a CustomItem, after that, you can easily use it with any command that CustomItems provides!
