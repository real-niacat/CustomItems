# [NWAPI] Plugin, not EXILED.
a simple, but capable custom item system! (currently WIP)


## Adding your own custom items!

it's pretty easy to add your own custom items! 

simply reference the CustomItems dll in your plugin and create a new instance of a CustomItem, after that, you can easily use it with any command that CustomItems provides!
due to the complexity of making it work with configs, unfortunately there is no alternative to this method.

## Installation

similar to any NWAPI plugin, you simply download the DLL and put it into appdata/roaming/SCP Secret Laboratory/PluginAPI/(port number OR global) and it'll just work
